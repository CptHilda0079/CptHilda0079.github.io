# Viper Command and Control Server/Agent

## What is a Command and Control (C2) server?

Simply put, a C2 server is a central control point that attackers use to manage communication with infected machines. When an attacker installs malware onto a company's network, it is usually configured to connect back to the C2 server (owned by the attacker), allowing the attacker to receive/send commands, exfiltrate data, and update the infected machine's malware to launch even more sophisticated attacks.

## How do C2 servers work?

When an attacker infiltrates a network and downloads malware, they need a way to control the flow of the malicious program; they do this by reaching back (Beaconing) to a C2 server and repeatedly checking for new commands/tasks, essentially asking the C2 server: "What commands should I run next?". If the connection is still active, the C2 server (owned by the attacker) will send commands back to the agent (infected machine). These commands may include:
