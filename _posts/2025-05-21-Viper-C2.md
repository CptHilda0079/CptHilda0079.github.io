Viper Command and Control Server/Agent

What is a Command and Control (C2) server?

Simply put, a C2 server is a central control point that attackers use to manage communication with infected machines. When an attacker installs malware onto a company's network, it is usually configured to connect back to the C2 server (owned by the attacker), allowing the attacker to receive/send commands, exfiltrate data, and update the infected machine's malware to launch even more sophisticated attacks.

How do C2 servers work?

When an attacker infiltrates a network and downloads malware, they then need a way to control the flow of the malicious software; they do this by reaching back (Beaconing) to a C2 server
